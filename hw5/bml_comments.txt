.    My simulation ran the traffic model at different densities of traffic. It used a 4x5 board. By increasing the density you would find an increase in the amount of gridlocks and if you decreased the density you would fine a decrease in the gridlocks. This is because the cars would run into each other at a much higher rate when there is a higher density of cars.
.    The way I tested this was i ran 1 simulation about 100 times. Each simulation was about 200 steps and my goal was to see if it would gridlock during those times. I would then total how many times it would gridlock in those 100 trials.
questions:
1) at very high levels of p, the traffic jams increased, especially in the higher 90%s. at around 100% it was fully blocked. at around 90% it was both free and blocked. at around 80% it was mostly free.
2) about 200
3) the smaller the grid the more likely it was for their to be gridlock at a certain percentage.
