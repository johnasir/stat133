#### PART I : General R commands [15 pts]

# [1 pt]
# Create [x], a numeric vector of length 1200 with 
# entries: 3, 6, 9, 12, etc
x <- seq(1200) * 3

  
# [2 pts]
# Create [y], a list of length 10 where list k
# stores the output of the k-times multiplication
# table, including values up to 1000 so
# y[[1]] is 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000

# [1 pt]
# Create [z], a logical vector of length 5000 with entries
# TRUE and FALSE, where each value has
#  a probability 0.3 of being TRUE and 0.7 of being FALSE
# Hint: you can e.g. use [sample()], you will need to set all 4 arguments
set.seed(42)
z <- sample(c(T, F), 5000, replace = T, c(.3, .7))
  
  
# [1 pt]
# Create [v], a numeric vector with the results of 100 rolls of a dice,
# i.e. each element is one of the numbers 1 through 6, with equal probability.
  set.seed(31415)
v <- sample(seq(6), 100, replace = T)


# [1 pt]
# Create [w], a character vector of length 26 with entries:
# "aa", "ab", "ac", "ad", ..., "az"
# Hint: the variable [letters] is an inbuilt constant in R 
# and stores the alphabet (try typing letters)
set.seed(2718)
w <- paste0("a", letters)

  
# [1 pt]
# Create [m], a matrix of size 10x10 with entries that are 
# Normal random variables (hint: rnorm) with mean 8
# (arrange the values by column, as per default)
set.seed(344)
m <- matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 8))

  
# For the next few tasks you will use the data frame ChickWeight
# This data frame comes with R so you do not need to load any data.
# To get the size of the data frame type
# dim(ChickWeight)
# To see the first few lines type
# head(ChickWeight)
# There are 4 variables in the dataframe:
# > names(ChickWeight)
# [1] "weight" "Time"   "Chick"  "Diet"  

# [1 pt]
# Create [cw1] a subset of ChickWeight with Chicks on 
# Diet 1 at time 0
cw1 <- ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet == 1 & ChickWeight$Time == 0,]

# Now create a table [t2] which is the same table as before except restricted
# to mothers with College education (use [ed])
# 
t2 <- table(infants[infants$ed == "College",]$smoke, infants[infants$ed == "College",]$number)


# [2 pts] 
# Calculate [bdiff], the difference in average birthweight [column bwt] between babies born to mothers
# that are 35 years or older and mothers that are under 35 years of age [use column age for mothers age]
#  
bdiff <- mean(infants[infants$age >= 35, ]$bwt, na.rm = T) - mean(infants[infants$age < 35, ]$bwt, na.rm = T)

#### PART II : Plotting [20 pts]

##### Cars [8 pts total, 2+3+3]
# We will now use the dataset "mtcars" which is icluded in the R package.
# To look at the dataframe you can just type "mtcars" at the prompt
# It is a data frame of size 32x12

# [2 pts]
# Make a box plot of [mpg] by [cyl] (so 3 boxplots in one plot)
boxplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl)

# [3 pts]
# Use the function [lm()] to fit a regression model of [qsec] (1/4 mile time) regressed on [hp] (horsepower)
# Make a scatterplot of [qsec] versus [hp] and add the regression line to it
# Hint: the regression coefficients are stored in [coef] in the lm object and you can use [abline()] to
# add a line to a plot
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$qsec)
# [3 pt]
# Make a scatterplot of [disp] (on y-axis) versus [wt] 
# where disp is the engine displacement in cu. in. and wt is the weight of the car in lb/1000.
# Color the plotting symbol by [am] (automatic or manual) (any 2 colors)
# Edit the labels on the x-axis and y-axis to state what the variables are.
# Hint: first do the plot without adding the colors.
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$disp)

##### We will now use the World Bank Data [12 pts]
load("WorldBank.RData")

# [4 pts]
# Make a scatterplot of life expectancy ["life.expectancy"] vs. fertility ["fertility.rate"]
# The plotting symbol should be a small dot (.)
# Please color the symbols by region (pick any color for each region)
# You do _NOT_ need to add a legend saying which color is which region.
# Put on custom made x-axis and y-axis labels that fully describe the variables
# Add a vertical line at fertility=2.1 (the rate needed to maintain constant population size)
plot(WorldBank$life.expectancy, WorldBank$fertility.rate)
abline(v = 2.1)

# [4 pts]
# Do you see patterns in the plot?  You just plotted these variables for all years between 1960 and 2014.
# Please redo the plot, but this time put two plots side by side (hint: before plotting set par(mfrow=...) )
# The left plot should include only data from 1960, the right one only from 2013.
plot(WorldBank$life.expectancy, WorldBank$fertility.rate)

# [4 pts]
# Make a histogram of GDP only for observations where the lending rating is "IDA"
# The width of the bars should be approximately 250 (use breaks to set how many bars)
# Add an x-axis label and a title.
hist(WorldBank[WorldBank$lending == "IDA", ]$GDP.per.capita.Current.USD, breaks = 24, main = "GDP of IDA Lending Countries", xlab = " GDP (in USD)")

# [2 pts]
# Create [max.rain], a vector where each entry is the _maximum_ element of the
# corresponding vector in the list rain

max.rain <- sapply(rain, max)

    
# [5 pts]
# Create [max.diff.rain], a vector of length 5 where each entry is the 
# __maximum absolute difference__ in rainfall on two consecutive days
# Hint: you can use the function [diff()] to get the difference between entry i and i+1 in a vector 
# and the function [abs()] for absolute value
max.diff.rain <- sapply(rain, function (x) max(abs(diff(x))))


# [5 pts]
# Create [prop.rain], a vector of length 5 where each entry is the 
# number of rain days (i.e. rain > 0) as a function of total days

prop.rain <- sapply(rain, function (x) sum(x > 0))
  

# [3 pts]
# Make a plot with 6 panels and plot the histogram of the rainfall for each weather station
# in a separate panel (there will be one empty panel)
# use an apply statment to the the plotting
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
sapply(rain, hist)

##### PART IV : functions [20 pts]

# [6 pts]
# Write a function, [GenNorm()] which generates a vector of random normal

#   sd (the standard deviation), default 1
#   n (the number of observations), default 1000
#   plot.hist (a logical variable, should we plot a histogram), default TRUE
# Output:

# [6 pts]
# Write a function [standardizeVar] with
# Input :
#     [m] : a numeric matrix
#     [cols] : TRUE or FALSE (default TRUE)
# Output :
#     a matrix of the same size as [m] where if cols==TRUE the columns have been standardized
#     and if cols==FALSE the rows have been standardized
#     we standardize by subtracting the mean of the column/row and dividing by the sd of the column/row


standardizeVar <- function(m, cols=TRUE){

#    [k] : a scalar, the number of permutations, default=5000

#    Assume that [cases] was of length j and [controls] of length m
#    Now select at random j individuals from the whole sample (i.e. all j+m observations)
#    and assign them to be cases, and the remaining m individuals as controls
#    Calculate the value [mean(cases)-mean(controls)] for each of these new samples

# Output
#    A vector of length k where each element is the value 
#    mean(cases)-mean(controls) for one permutation

# Simulate a simplified lottery and return the number of people who share the
# jackpot.

# Setup:
# Each player can pick 3 numbers from the numbers 1 through 19 (no duplicates)
# There are [k] players that buy a ticket.
# All player with the winning numbers share the jackpot

# Write a function NumJackpot with:

# Input

# So in each of the B games you have to :
#    generate the winning numbers
#    set a counter for jackpot winners to 0
#    generate a ticket for each player in turn, if they had the winning numbers 
#    increase the counter by 1

NumJackpot <- function(k, B){
