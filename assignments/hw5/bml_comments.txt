.    My simulation ran the traffic model at different densities of traffic. It used a 4x5 board. By increasing the density you would find an increase in the amount of gridlocks and if you decreased the density you would fine a decrease in the gridlocks. This is because the cars would run into each other at a much higher rate when there is a higher density of cars.
.    The way I tested this was i ran 1 simulation about 100 times. Each simulation was about 500 steps and my goal was to see if it would gridlock during those times. I would then total how many times it would gridlock in those 100 trials.
